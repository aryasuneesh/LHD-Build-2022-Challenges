# Dino Clone - Javascript Game

## Inspiration

As I have zero experience with JS, i decided to do a follow-along tutorial and learn some JS while building this game for the challenge. 

## What it does

A clone of Chrome Dino game using HTML, CSS and JS, but there is no dino or cactuses. Just two rectangles moving and jumping around.

## How we built it

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript

## What we learned

I have now learnt some elements of JS and would like to learn deeper for improving my web dev skills.

## What's next for Replica of Chrome Dino game

Right now, the game runs on a loop. I would like to add a start and stop feature to it.

## What does Timerhack do

The project executes a simple timer. We can input the time for which the timer should run and it will countdown till the given time. The timer will play a sound and display text to indicate end of set timer.

## How I built it

I built it using Python. The libraries used are time and playsound.

## Challenges I ran into

One challenge was getting the playsound library to work. I ran into some trouble bringing the sound file to the correct folder and getting it to run in the correct way.

## What I learned

I was able to explore the time and playsound libraries and implement it for good use.

## What's next for Timer Hack

First, I would like to make a GUI for it or convert it into a web app for ease of usage. I would love to implement a stopwatch feature and even introduce buttons to lap and reset while the timer is running.
